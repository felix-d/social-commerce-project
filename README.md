### TODO
#### ~~Creating User objects when logging in with Facebook API~~
Currently using [django-allauth](https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth).
Adding more authentication methods would be a walk in the park
#### ~~Getting the products to fill the database~~
The script [tools/get_movies.py](https://github.com/felix-d/social-commerce-project/blob/master/tools/get_movies.py) fetches from [The Movie Database Api](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) the information of 275 movies and their poster images.
The images are stored in [tools/images/](https://github.com/felix-d/social-commerce-project/tree/master/tools/images)
The information is stored in [tools/movies.csv](https://github.com/felix-d/social-commerce-project/blob/master/tools/movies.csv#L9)
#### ~~Writing a script to fill the database from the csv file~~
#### ~~Extend user model with step field~~
The user model was extended with a one to one relationship to UserStep. This is the clean and recommended way of extending the User model
according to Django docs.
#### ~~Implement a middleware to intercept http requests and redirect the user depending on his status and step count~~
#### ~~Creating products app model~~
#### ~~Creating questionnaires app model~~
#### ~~Creating reviews app models~~
#### ~~Creating users app models~~
#### ~~Creating analytics app models~~
#### ~~Updating friendships on logging~~

Now when a user logs in, a new friendship is created in the database if it doesn't exist yet

#### ~~Create a reviewing app with React + Flux for phase1~~~
#### ~~Create questionnaire page from the questionnaire models~~
#### ~~Add share dialog with javascript sdk and ajax callback to update step count~~
#### User-agent sniffing to prevent mobile users from using the app
#### Add error handling for faulty ajax calls
#### Change static files urls to dynamic urls to choose between dev and prod given a predefined setting (template tag?)
#### Write gulp tasks for prod (concatenation & minification)
#### ...
